An instance of this class is thrown in cases where the driver is sleeping or waiting on a condition, and has to catch InterruptedException and do something besides swallowing it.  Since InterruptedException is checked and so can't be thrown from methods that don't declare it, best thing to do it throw a runtime exception that can be handled in the application"

Removed support for unlimited pool size.  Now there is a single maximum size of the pool, representing the total number of potentially available and in-use members   2. Semaphore now has one permit for each pool member that are potentially available (either in available list or could be created).   3. Synchronized on this.  Only enter synchronization block in get method if a permit has been acquired   4. Keeping track of list of available members (_avail) and set of checked out members (_out).     Get method removes from _avail or creates new member, and adds to _out.  Done method removes from _out and adds to _avail.   5. Removed debug and track leaks support   6. Updated JMX monitoring interface to reflect the new structure."

This turned out to be more of a refactoring than hoped, to clean up code while fixing issue. Solution: - positive batchsize tells server the ideal size of a batch returned - negative batchsize tells server to return 1 batch of maximum that size, or whatever fits in a 4MB batch, and close the cursor - positive limit does limit the total number of documents to return on cursor. Once limit is reached, cursor should be called automatically by driver. - negative limit is only supported for legacy reason. It sets the batchSize to that negative value."

Only enter synchronization block in get method if a permit has been acquired   4. Keeping track of list of available members (_avail) and set of checked out members (_out).

Removed support for unlimited pool size.  Now there is a single maximum size of the pool, representing the total number of potentially available and in-use members   2. Semaphore now has one permit for each pool member that are potentially available (either in available list or could be created).   3. Synchronized on this.  Only enter synchronization block in get method if a permit has been acquired   4. Keeping track of list of available members (_avail) and set of checked out members (_out).     Get method removes from _avail or creates new member, and adds to _out.  Done method removes from _out and adds to _avail.   5. Removed debug and track leaks support   6. Updated JMX monitoring interface to reflect the new structure."

Once limit is reached, cursor should be called automatically by driver. - negative limit is only supported for legacy reason. It sets the batchSize to that negative value."
